# Project5

Problem: In project 5 we had to generate hamming distance information, then present that information in a GUI. We also had to implement a creative component of the GUI>

Approach: I basically just figured out how to properly use JavaFX, and it was pretty straightforward from there for the noncreative section. I knew what information I needed and how to get it, so all I had to do was create a GUI that would display it.
The creative portion was much more difficult. I knew what I wanted to do, but I only had a vague idea of how to accomplish it, and I was not sure it was even possible. But it ended up working better than I had hoped for.

Variables: Aside from from some ints and doubles used in calculations, my variables are almost all arraylists used to store the contents of the file. Centipede also has a LinkedHashMap that stores both the location and value of the centipede itself. It relies heavily on the ordered nature of the LinkedHashMap to retain the order of the centipede.

Methods: I tried to cleanly seperate functionality in my methods this time around. I believe that for the most part, they do a good job of encompassing discrete tasks and simplifying the code. Centipede could likely use at least one more which would be responsible for detecting out of bounds values, but it is not terrible as it is now. 

Code Analysis: I believe my code is quite well organized, especially considering I had no idea how to really accomplish creating centipede. 
If I had the opportunity to do it again, it would be much the same, possibly with the aforemention new method for centipede.
